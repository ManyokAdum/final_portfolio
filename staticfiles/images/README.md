- Ensure images are properly cropped and centered

## Temporary Placeholder:

If you don't have images ready, you can use placeholder services like:

- Create solid color backgrounds with project names

## Note:

Replace these placeholder images with your actual project screenshots and profile photo before deploying to production.
